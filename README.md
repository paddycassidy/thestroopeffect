# The Stroop Effect
A web-based javascript game that is designed to test your response inhibition using colours. The game is based on a psychological study conducted in 1935 by John Ridley Stroop. Stroop's study involved a colour-word task to demonstrate interference between reading an objects name and naming an object - later known as the 'Stroop Effect'.

## About the game

The player is instructed to select the correct colour based on one of two specified criteria at a time. 

1. The colour of a specific word in the scene
2. The meaning of the word displayed in the scene

The possible answers will be displayed on the page for the player to select the correct one.
